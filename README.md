### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Arvid Harder


I am a PhD student at [KI-PGI](https://ki.se/en/meb/ki-psychiatric-genomics-institute) (KI Psychiatric genomics institute). My PhD is focused on improving functional understanding of genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders and improving clinical stratification in major depression disorder (with the goal of providing better treatments) using omics data.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on characterising efficacy of polygenic scores for psychiatric disorders in population samples and standardizing cleaning of GWAS summary statistics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about molecular biology, programming in rust, writing R packages
