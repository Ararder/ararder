### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Arvid Harder


I am a joint PhD student at [KI-PGI](https://ki.se/en/meb/ki-psychiatric-genomics-institute) and [Hjerling-Leffler lab](http://www.hjerling-leffler-lab.org) working at the intersection of neuroscience and psychiatric genetics. My PhD is focused on improving functional understanding of genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders, and the procceses that regulate alternative splicing in the brain.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on alternative splicing in the brain, speeding up data-analysis using genetic and genomics data. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about molecular biology & using Rust for bioinformatics and data science.
