### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Arvid Harder


I am a joint PhD student at [KI-PGI](https://ki.se/en/meb/ki-psychiatric-genomics-institute) and [Hjerling-Leffler lab](http://www.hjerling-leffler-lab.org) working at the intersection of neuroscience and psychiatric genetics. My PhD is focused on improving functional understanding of genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders and improving clinical stratification in major depression disorder.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on characterising efficacy of polygenic scores in depression, alternative splicing in schizophrenia, harmonizing and standardized analysis of summary statistics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about molecular biology, programming in Rust, writing R packages
